# The Movie Spot - All the info on your favourite movies!

This application was built using React.js. It displays movie data fetched from the OMDB api based on the title the user has searched. It allows a user to shortlist up to five movies and then displays their favourites below. The user is notified when their favourites list is full. The user is warned when they attempt to favourite the same movie twice. The user can remove nominees from their list and add new movies until the list reaches five nominations. 

A live demo can be found at https://katrinapo.github.io/the-shoppies/.
