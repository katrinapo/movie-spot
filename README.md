# The Shoppies - Movie Awards for Entrepreneurs 

This application was built using React.js. It displays movie data fetched from the OMDB api based on the title the user has searched. It allows a user to nominate up to five movies and then displays the nominations below. The user is notified when their nomination list is full. The user is warned when they attempt to nominate the same movie twice. The user can remove nominees from their list and add new movies until the list reaches five nominations.
